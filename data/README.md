# Experimental Data: BER and Energy Harvesting

This folder contains the experimental measurements obtained from the bidirectional LED-to-LED Visible Light Communication (VLC) system.  
The datasets are stored in `.csv` format and can be opened with Excel, Python, MATLAB, or any compatible software.

## Description of the files

- **ber_red.csv** â†’ Bit Error Rate (BER) measurements using the red LED channel.  
- **ber_green.csv** â†’ Bit Error Rate (BER) measurements using the green LED channel.  
- **ber_blue.csv** â†’ Bit Error Rate (BER) measurements using the blue LED channel.  

- **energy_red.csv** â†’ Energy harvesting measurements with red LED illumination.  
- **energy_green.csv** â†’ Energy harvesting measurements with green LED illumination.  
- **energy_blue.csv** â†’ Energy harvesting measurements with blue LED illumination.  

## Notes
- Each `.csv` file includes **columns for input optical power, received voltage, and the measured value (BER or harvested energy)**.  
- Units are specified in the first row of each file.  
- Data can be directly plotted or analyzed to reproduce the figures presented in the paper.
