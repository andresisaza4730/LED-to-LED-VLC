# Experimental Data

This folder contains the **.csv** files with the experimental measurements carried out for the VLC (Visible Light Communication) system for communication and energy harvesting.

Each file includes:
- **BER (Bit Error Rate):** ratio of erroneous bits in the LED-to-LED communication.  
- **Energy harvesting:** amount of energy harvested by the receiving LED during transmission.  

### Included files

- `Medicion del harvesting y el Ber  (Azul RX - TX).csv`  
  Contains the experimental data obtained when using a **blue LED as transmitter (TX)** and a **blue LED as receiver (RX)**.
